# Welcome to sfdx

## Introduction to sfdx
Salesforce Developer Experience (‘SFDX’ or just ‘DX’) is a process designed to improve the traditional developer’s experience of building, managing and integrating work items. It is composed of various componenets including the Salesforce CLI, an integrated development environment (such as Visual Studio Code) and the use of DevHub/scratch orgs.

## Why is it important?
Salesforce DX supports a source-driven development approach, which is a fundamental aspect of building in Salesforce. Its functionalities have enabled teams to adopt version control processes and streamline their workflows. SFDX has therefore become a favoured tool amongst Salesforce developers and is giving rise to the capabilities of DevOps.

## How is it useful?
When creating a new work item, developers can easily spin up a new scratch org, apply their required changes and test their requirements. Once they are happy with their development, SFDX comes into play to pull the metadata changes from the scratch org, which can then be committed to the project's main repository. Similarly, Salesforce developers can also deploy their repository's contents into various environments through simple SFDX commands.
